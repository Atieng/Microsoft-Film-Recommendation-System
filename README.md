### MICROSOFT FILM ANALYSIS


![alt text](poster.jpeg)

### Project Overview
This analysis is for Microsoft and they want me to use this analysis to generate insights for the business stakeholder

### Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create

### Data Understanding
For the analysis I will be using movie datasets from:
- [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com)
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
- [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- [The numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. 
Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software
or pd.read_csv, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.This is the ERD for the
IMBD data as shown below
